## Development guide

*This plugin is built with the help of four github librairies: [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/), [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types), [Figma Plugin Typing](https://github.com/figma/plugin-typings) and [Figma Plugin Helpers](https://github.com/figma-plugin-helper-functions/figma-plugin-helpers).*

### Pre-requisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org) ‚Äì v18
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [preact](https://preactjs.com/)

To install one of those packages type in the terminal at the root of your project:

```
$ yourPackageName install
```

As mentionned before, this plugin uses outside librairies:

- [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/) ‚Äì ./ui, ./build, ./tsconfig and ./utilities
- [Figma Plugin Helpers](https://github.com/figma-plugin-helper-functions/figma-plugin-helpers)
- [Figma Plugin Typing](https://github.com/figma/plugin-typings) 
- [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types) - ./react and ./prismjs

In order for the plugin to retrieve the functions coming from those librairies, you should type the following commands (in your project terminal):

```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/react
$ npm install --save-dev @types/prismjs
$ npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings
$ npm install --save-dev @create-figma-plugin/tsconfig
$ npm install --save-dev @create-figma-plugin/build
$ npm install @create-figma-plugin/ui 
$ npm install @create-figma-plugin/utilities
$ npm install @figma-plugin/helpers
```
Those command will update your *package.json* file

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin, open the terminal at the root of your project and type:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically, you can also run :

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest‚Ä¶` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.
