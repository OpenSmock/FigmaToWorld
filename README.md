With FigmaToWorld, exporting your Figma design to a *JSON* file has never been so easy !

This plugin allows you to export the node tree of the Figma design into a *JSON* file containing the same architecture. You can choose between several modes that allow you to download either the whole design, the current page or a selection.

## User guide
First of all, you should know that this plugin is not yet published in the Figma community plugin library. So, to load and use it, you will need the desktop version of the Figma application.

Open the design you want to export and go to *Plugins>Development>Import plugin from manifest*, as shown in the image below.

Then, the plugin will launch and should look something like that:

Here, you have two choices. Either you want your *JSON* file to have the same name as your design, in this case click directly on *Download your design to JSON*. Otherwise, enter the name that suits you. You will then be able to choose the location where to upload your file. 

That's it, your *JSON* file is created !

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with the help of four github librairies: [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/), [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types), [Figma Plugin Typing](https://github.com/figma/plugin-typings) and [Figma Plugin Helpers](https://github.com/figma-plugin-helper-functions/figma-plugin-helpers).*

### Pre-requisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org) ‚Äì v18
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [preact](https://preactjs.com/)

To install one of those packages type in the terminal at the root of your project:

```
$ yourPackageName install
```

As mentionned before, this plugin uses outside librairies:

- [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/) ‚Äì ./ui, ./build, ./tsconfig and ./utilities
- [Figma Plugin Helpers](https://github.com/figma-plugin-helper-functions/figma-plugin-helpers)
- [Figma Plugin Typing](https://github.com/figma/plugin-typings) 
- [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types) - ./react and ./prismjs

In order for the plugin to retrieve the functions coming from those librairies, you should type the following commands (in your project terminal):

```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/react
$ npm install --save-dev @types/prismjs
$ npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings
$ npm install --save-dev @create-figma-plugin/tsconfig
$ npm install --save-dev @create-figma-plugin/build
$ npm install @create-figma-plugin/ui 
$ npm install @create-figma-plugin/utilities
$ npm install @figma-plugin/helpers
```
Those command will update your *package.json* file

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin, open the terminal at the root of your project and type:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically, you can also run :

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest‚Ä¶` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.
